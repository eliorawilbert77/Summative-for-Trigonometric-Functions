# Summative-for-Trigonometric-Functions
Before you can run this, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the numpy and matplotlib libraries.
select the trigonometric function you wish to plot and enter the desired range for the x-values. It will then display the graph using Matplotlib.
This Python code offers a simple, interactive method of plotting basic trigonometric functions: sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). Plotting functions are chosen by the user, as well as the range of x-values that the function will be plotted over. It provides a simple use for graphical exploration of these mathematical functions using the matplotlib visualization tool and the numpy library for mathematical operations
